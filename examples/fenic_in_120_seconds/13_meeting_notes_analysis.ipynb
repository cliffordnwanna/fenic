We've only tested on iOS 16+, but our user base includes iOS 15 users. Should we expand testing? Sarah: Good point. Lisa, can you coordinate with QA to include iOS 15 testing by February 5th? Lisa: Sure, I'll reach out to Jennifer today. Tom: What about the marketing campaign? We need final product screenshots for the landing page. Sarah: Mike, once API docs are done, can you provide test data for Tom's screenshots? Mike: Absolutely. I'll have sample API responses ready by February 1st. Sarah: Perfect. Any other blockers?

I need two weeks to implement auto-scaling. David: That's priority one. Emily, please have a cost optimization plan by February 2nd. Also, we need to delay the new feature development until costs are under control. Mark: What about the hiring plans? We have three open engineering positions. David: Let's pause hiring until we see the cost improvements. Mark, can you put those requisitions on hold? Mark: I already sent offers to two candidates.

Jessica: They need a custom webhook for their CRM. It's beyond my technical scope. Anna: Let me connect you with the engineering team. I'll set up a meeting with Mike for next Wednesday. Rachel: I have an update on the customer satisfaction survey. Response rate is only 12%, way below our 25% target. Anna: Hmm, that's concerning. What do you think is causing the low response? Rachel: The survey is too long - 15 questions. Customers are abandoning it. Anna: Good insight. Rachel, can you create a shorter version with just 5 key questions by end of week? Rachel: Definitely. I'll focus on the most important metrics. Jessica: Also, GlobalCorp mentioned they'd be interested in our premium support tier. Anna: Excellent!

CEO Sarah: Lisa, what's our technical debt situation? CTO Lisa: Manageable but growing. I recommend dedicating one engineer full-time to refactoring in Q2. CFO Michael: What's the cost impact? CTO Lisa: About $120K in salary costs, but it'll prevent much larger problems later. CEO Sarah: Approved. Lisa, identify the engineer and start in April. VP Sales Tom: Pipeline looks strong for Q1. We have $800K in qualified opportunities. CEO Sarah: Tom, what's your confidence on closing rate? VP Sales Tom: 65% based on current conversations. One concern - two major prospects asked about SOC2 compliance. CEO Sarah: We need to prioritize that. Michael, can you research SOC2 compliance costs? CFO Michael: I'll get quotes from auditors and have recommendations by February 15th. CEO Sarah: Perfect. Any other strategic issues?
